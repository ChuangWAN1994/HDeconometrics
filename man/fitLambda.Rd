\title{Fit the parameter lambda of the Bayesian VAR}
\usage{
fitLambda(Y, variables = 1, lambdaseq = seq(0, 1, 0.1), p = 1,
  p.reduced = p, delta = 0, xreg = NULL, scale = TRUE, ps = FALSE,
  tau = 10 * lambdaseq)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Time-series matrix or data.frame with the VAR endogenous variables.}

\item{variables}{Either a numeric vector indication the position of the variables to be included in the small model or a characted vector with the variable names.}

\item{lambdaseq}{Sequence of lambdas to be tested.}

\item{p}{Lag order (default = 1).}

\item{p.reduced}{Lag order of the small model.}

\item{delta}{Numeric vector indicating the prior for the autorregressive coefficients (default = 0 for all variables). If the prior is the same for all variables the user may supply a single number. Otherwise the vector must have one element for each variable.}

\item{xreg}{Exogenous controls.}

\item{scale}{If TRUE the variables are centered with variance equal 1 (default is TRUE).}

\item{ps}{If TRUE the priors on the sum of the coefficients will be included.}

\item{tau}{Controls the shrinkage in the priors on the sum of the coefficients.}
}
\description{
Fit the parameter lambda of the Bayesian VAR. This parameter controls the importance given to the priors. If lambda=0 the model is the same as the OLS case. For bigger values of lambda more importance is given to the priors and less importance to the data.
}
\details{
The choice of lambda is arbitrary. However, Banbura et al. (2010) uses the fit of a smaller model with just a few variables as a target to the Bayesian VAR. In other words, this function chooses the lambda that matches the fit of a smaller model chosen by the user on the chosen Bayesian VAR. If lambda = 0 the model ignores the data and the posterior equal the prior. For bigger lambda the model converges to the OLS  estimates.
